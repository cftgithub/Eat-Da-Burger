# Eat-Da-Burger
## Overview
* This app uses ORM (Object Relational Mapping) and MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern. 
* Node and MySQL is used to query and route data.
* Handlebars is used to generate HTML.
## How It Works
* The menu consists of a list of burgers each with a "Devour It!" button. Clicking on the button will move the item to the "Devoured" list.
* The "Devoured" list gives you the option of deleting the burger or adding the burger back to the menu.
* User can also type in a new burger and add it to the menu.
* Burgers are stored in a database using a boolean to determine whether the burger has been devoured.
